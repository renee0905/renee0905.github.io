Background
natural history collection is one of the most important in the world, documenting 4.5 billion years of life, the Earth and the solar system. Almost all animal, plant, mineral and fossil groups are represented.
The portal's main dataset consists of specimens from the Museum's collection database, with 4,933,455 records from the Museumâ€™s Entomology, Zoology, Botany, Palaeontology, Mineralogy collections.
They also have 756,866 species-level (index lot) records, which denote the presence of a taxon in the Museum collection.

Layout
The filter founction is on the left of the page. By enlarging or reducing the size of the window, the layout stays identical (i.e. the photo preview on the main page are adusted in size, but the number of photos per row and their position remains the same).
The number of total thumbnails shows just below the photo itself.

Filter functionality
Users can select the picture's barcode from the dropdown menu or use the checkboxes to filter their search by collection.
